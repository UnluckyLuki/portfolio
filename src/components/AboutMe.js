                I am a computer science graduate with a passion for programming and solving technology problems. I
                specialize in Java and JavaScript, developing a solid foundation in backend and frontend application
                development. During my studies, I have done academic projects using Spring Boot, React and Node.js.
                I love working on challenges that allow me to develop skills and gain new experiences. I am eager to
                learn new technologies and tools, adapting to the dynamic needs of projects. I am looking for a first
                job where I can apply my knowledge, support the team and grow as a programmer.
